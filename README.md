# VISTA

A very simple web interface to simulate sensors and promote their values via MQTT to [Visual Components](https://www.visualcomponents.com) 4.x (needs [MQTT Addon](https://github.com/ZeMAMaxEichenwald/visual_components_MQTT_Addon?utm_source=chatgpt.com), tested in 2024). VISTA appends the project topic and the sensor topic to "vc/signal/input/" to fit the topic structure top the Visual Components MQTT AddOn. Used it for lab sessions in the area of IoT and Digital Twins.

Upload the files to a server of your choice and browse to the path. Have fun and alter it to your liking. Happy about anyone who wants to work on this in a fork or contribute to this project.
