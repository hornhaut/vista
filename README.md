# VISTA

A very simple web interface to simulate sensors and promote their values via MQTT to visual components (needs MQTT plugin, tested in 2024). Used it for lab sessions in the area of IoT and Digital Twins.

upload the files to a server of your choice and browse to the path, have fun and alter it to your liking. Happy about anyone who wants to work on this in a fork or contribute to this project.
